# Plain Old Javascript Documentation

Quick and dirty proof of concept code for a POD-like inline code
documentation system for Javascript code. Needs quite a bit of work
before it would be useful.

## Howto

```
1. Have node installed.
2. Run 'npm install'
3. Run 'bin/pojd bin/pojd'
4. Profit!
```

## Why not JSDoc?

Because I don't really want pretty HTML documentation with a
publishing workflow. I want plain text, on the CLI, that's generated
right then, so I know it's always in sync with the code. Plus I guess
I'm just a set-in-my-ways Perl coder at heart...
